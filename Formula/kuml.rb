  # The kuml-runtime-<version>-<os>-<arch>.zip is a self-contained bundle:
  # app jars + a jlink-built Java 21 runtime. No external JDK dependency.
  #
  # jlink produces a JRE for the host platform it's invoked on, so we must
  # ship one zip per target. Older releases (≤ 0.1.1) shipped a single
  # zip built on a Linux runner — that zip is broken on macOS. The 0.1.1
  # placeholders below are kept only to document the layout; they MUST
  # be overwritten by a re-release of 0.1.1 (or the next tag) that runs
  # the matrixed release.yml in kuml-dev/kuml.
  #
  # url/sha256 blocks are rewritten automatically by update-formula.yml
  # in this tap, triggered by a repository_dispatch event from
  # kuml-dev/kuml's release workflow on every `v*.*.*` tag.
