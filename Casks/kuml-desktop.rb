  # The kuml-desktop-<version>.dmg is built by the `desktop-dmg` job in
  # kuml-dev/kuml's release.yml (V3.2.14) via the Compose Multiplatform
  # `packageDmg` task, then signed (Developer ID, hardened runtime) and
  # notarized (V3.2.25/27) before upload — verified in the v0.24.0 release run
  # (notarization status: Accepted). The `version`/`url`/`sha256` fields below
  # are rewritten automatically by update-cask.yml in this tap, triggered by a
  # repository_dispatch event (type "kuml-desktop-release") from
  # kuml-dev/kuml's release workflow on every `v*.*.*` tag.
